Chart 1
X-Axis: Number of files used to train with
Y-Axis: Average time taken to train on that number of files
Series: Different combinations of domains (wgl2 and tnt) and fragmented or 
non-fragmented on the sketches while training

Chart 2
X-Axis: Number of files used to train with
Y-Axis: Average overall accuracy when tested on testSet
Series: Different combinations of fragmented during training or not and fragmented 
during testing or not
	train only: fragmented while training; not fragmented while testing (these were 
		the standard training and testing conditions)
	both frag: fragmented while both training and testing
	no frag: not fragmented during either training or testing
	test only: not fragmented while training; fragmented while testing

Chart 3
X-Axis: Number of files used to train with
Y-Axis: Average individual accuracies using wgl2 tested on testSet
Series: Wire, gate, and label accuracies

Chart 4
X-Axis: Number of files  used to train with
Y-Axis: Average accuracy using tnt tested on testSet
Series: Non-text, text, and overall accuracies

Chart 5
X-Axis: Number of files used to train with
Y-Axis: Accuracy using wgl2 tested on testSet (Note this is NOT average accuracy)
Series: Wire, label, gate, and overall accuracies

Chart 6
X-Axis: Number of files used to train with
Y-Axis: Time taken to train on that number of files (Note this is NOT average time)

Chart 7
X-Axis: Number of files used to train with
Y-Axis: Overall accuracy using wgl2 on testSet (Note this is NOT average accuracy)
NOTE- Chart7-colored has this same graph, but with lines from data from the smaller 
trainer set to the data from the bigger set (so there is a line connecting the 
overall accuracy of Eight1 and Eight2 to the overall accuracy of All) 

Chart 8
X-Axis: Number of files used to train with
Y-Axis: Overall accuracy using tnt on testSet
NOTE- This graph is of the same type as Chart 7 and has a corresponding colored 
picture named Chart8-colored.
