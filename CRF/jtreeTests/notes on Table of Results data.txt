The first sheet in Table of Results (called testSet) is the result of testing on the 
following set of sketches

testSet:
HMC users 1, 5 and 10
UC Riverside users 2 and 6
(sketches can be found in the repository under 
Data\Gate Study Data\LabeledSketches\TabletPC and then either HMC or UCR)

We trained on 16 different single sketches one at a time, and recorded the accuracies
that resulted from testing on testSet. We then combined two of the 16 original sketches
to have 8 doubles to train on, and recorded those accuracies. The name of the two files 
above another file show which files were used in which sets.

For example:
H2_1 (HMC user 2 sketch 1) and H7_2 (HMC user 7 sketch 2) are both above H1. This means 
we had the CRF train on both of them together and labeled the trained file H1.

We started off using the gate/non-gate labeling (section 1; sections are seperated with
a dark blue line). Then we moved onto wire/gate/label labeling (section 2), however, we 
removed HMC user 3 because it was taking a significant amount of time to train on those 
files (we're guessing because of the very dense dots used to signify that two wire 
intersect). Those sketches were replaced with H4_2 and H8_2. This was done in order to 
get a rough idea of accuracies in a 2-way classifier versus a 3-way one.

Section 3
Next we wanted to see how accuracy and time taken to train changed as one sketch at a
time was added from the set of 8 sketches called Eight2 to the full set of 16 sketches.
However, when we did this is was after we modified the full-wgl.txt file to reflect a 
minor change in labeling. Eight2New, nine, ten, eleven2, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, 
fifteen, and allNew used full-wgl2 whicle Eight2 and all were just the values from the
previous set of data on the Excel sheet copy-pasted down.

Section 4
The next set of data on this sheet is all of the second set of data retrained using
full-wgl2 instead of full-wgl.

Section 5
This section on this sheet is a continuation of the adding one sketch at a time 
data, but this time the goal was to see how many sketches were needed before the 
accuracies would stop improving.

Section 6
This is the same as Section 3 but using text/non-text instead of wire/gate/label.

Section 7
This is the same as Section 3 but without fragmenting the data when training it 
(taking out the -ft)

Section 8
Same as Section 3 but with fragmenting the data when testing. (puting in a -f in 
the brackets)

Section 9
This section combines 7 and 8 in that it has the results from using the 
non-fragmented tcrfs from Section 7 and testing on the fragmented testSet.

Section 10
Training and testing in tnt without fragmenting during training.

NOTE: Data taken using the same tcrfs should have the same times since all times are 
from training and NOT from testing.

The second sheet, testSet2, took the trained CRFs from the first sheet Section 4, 5, 
and 6 and tested them on a different set of sketches called testSet2, consisting of 
the following:

testSet2:
HMC users 6 and 11
UC Riverside users 8, 10, and 11

EricTestSet
This sheet was started in an attempt to compare our CRF results to that of Eric P's 
but it turns out some of the sketches were too complicated for it to handle, so we 
stopped fairly early into it.

The next sheet, Family Tree, was an attempt to see if the CRF would run in a different 
domain. In this case, we were testing the Family Tree domain instead of the Digital 
Circuits domain, and we tested on the same sketch we trained on (to make sure we got 100% 
accuracy). However, we soon stopped since the program didn't want to work on 
anything other than the simplest sketches.

The 5th sheet was used to compare testing time and classification accuracies for jtree 
and loopybp. The jtree data of the 3rd section on this sheet was taken from the next 
sheet, WGL. The only different is that the testing times for the sets was included.

The 6th sheet, WGL, holds the results from training and testing on data in the folder 
Data\WGL. The sketches in a set are as follows

Training (8 sketches): 0128_6.1.1, 0502_3.6.1, 11-6_2.2.1, 1106_2.4.1, 1357_3.7.1, 
2468_3.3.1, 3274_3.2.1, and 9171_3.8.1

Training2 (8 sketches): 0268_1.7.1, 0268_3.3.1, 0268_3.4.1, 0268_3.7.1, 1106_2.1.1, 
1585_2.5.1, 1878_2.2.1, and 4242_1.3.1

Testing (10 sketches): 0128_1.6.1, 0128_3.5.1, 0268_2.6.1, 0268_3.5.1, 0502_3.5.1, 
1106_2.3.1, 1234_3.1.1, 1500_3.4.1, 1585_2.7.1, and 9171_3.2.1

Testing2 (6 sketches): 0128_3.6.1, 0502_3.10.1, 1234_3.4.1, 1585_2.2.1, 4242_1.2.1, 
and 4242_2.7.1 

The name of the set above the row "Tested On" is the set that was trained on.

The final sheet, Summary, has the averages from the first two sheets side by side for
an easier comparison.
